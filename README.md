# Pregnancy Calendar

This is a simple Sinatra app giving the user a possibility to state the date
of the first date of the period, days in menstrual cyclus and length of her
luteal phase. The result will be a downloadable iCalendar file or a direct
link to add the calendar to the users Google Calendar.

# Running example

calendar.
